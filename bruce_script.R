### Data Collection


# Set your Genius API token for accessing the Genius API (this will be unique to your account)
# See here fore more info on using the Genius API (https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1)

GENIUS_API_TOKEN <-"your token here"

# Load album list. I put this together myself, but you could also 
# scrape this info from the internet
albums <- read_csv(here("albums10.csv"), col_names = TRUE)

# Combine artist name on albums data
albums_tbl <- tibble(artist = c(rep("Bruce Springsteen", 20)), album = albums$Title, year = albums$Year)

# Map genius data (which includes lyrics) on album data
# This step take awhile as R maps the genius_album function
# from the 'genius' package and scrapes the lyrics from the internet)
album_lyrics <- albums_tbl %>% 
                mutate(tracks = map2(artist, album, genius_album))

# Pull out the lyrics for processing
lyrics <- album_lyrics %>% 
  unnest(tracks) %>%    
  arrange(desc(artist))
lyrics <- as.data.frame(lyrics)
lyrics_text <- lyrics$lyric


### Prepare data for text mining


# Remove punctuation marks and alphanumeric characters from lyrics
lyrics_text<- gsub('[[:punct:]]+', '', lyrics_text)
lyrics_text<- gsub("([[:alpha:]])\1+", "", lyrics_text)

# Define the song lyrics as our corpus
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(lyrics_text))

# Convert all lyrics to lowercase
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))

# Remove common English stopwords
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))

# create 'Term Document Matrix' (TDM)
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(tdm)


### Word Frequency Overview


# Count word frequencies in decreasing order
word_freqs = sort(rowSums(m), decreasing=TRUE) 
# Create a table with words and their frequencies
lyrics_wc_df <- data.frame(word=names(word_freqs), freq=word_freqs)
lyrics_wc_df <- lyrics_wc_df[1:300,]

# Plot in a word cloud
set.seed(22)
wordcloud(words = lyrics_wc_df$word, freq = lyrics_wc_df$freq, 
          min.freq = 1,scale=c(1.8,.5),
          max.words=400, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.05,
